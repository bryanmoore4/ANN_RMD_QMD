Note on the files:

randomness testing is to visualize the data that you haveusing a 3d graphical approach

time_series_ANN_Moore.py is a python file that runs with the data on this github repo, and 
can be run on your machine without the hpc

time_series_ANN_mult_seq_hpc is the most recently update python script that I use on all the data I have in my
hpc account. Since you don't have all that data, I'll try to get access to everyone

time_series_example_11616 is the LSTM example with the airlines I showed during my presentation on 12/6/16
if you want to check it out, here is the url http://machinelearningmastery.com/time-series-prediction-lstm-recurrent-neural-networks-python-keras/

the other directory inside this github is just where the data (105 data points in thisrepo) is located.
